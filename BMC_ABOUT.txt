About me — lancesir

Hi — I’m Lance. I create lightweight, easy-to-use static website templates and local rental listings so people can get online quickly without build tools or complex setups.

Why support me? Small projects still have ongoing costs: hosting, image hosting/CDN, domain renewals, and occasional paid assets. Your support helps cover those expenses and lets me spend time improving templates, fixing accessibility issues, and adding small features people ask for.

Thank you for stopping by and for any support — even sharing the project helps. If you'd like something specific (a small customization, tutorial, or accessibility improvement), message me and I’ll do my best to prioritize it.

— Lance
