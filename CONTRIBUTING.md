# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this template! Contributions that improve accessibility, clarity, bug fixes, documentation, and examples are welcome.

How to contribute
- Open an issue to discuss significant changes before starting work.
- For small fixes (typos, doc tweaks), open a pull request directly.
- Use clear, focused commits and a descriptive PR title.

Reporting bugs
- Open an issue and include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and any browser/OS details.

Feature requests
- Describe the user problem, an example use case, and an optional implementation approach.

Branching and PRs
- Branch from `main` (or create a feature branch named `feature/…` or `fix/…`).
- Open a pull request against `main` and include a short description of changes and testing steps.

Code style
- Keep markup simple and accessible. Use semantic HTML where possible.
- CSS should follow the existing style in `sass/` and `css/`.

Testing
- This is a static site template. To preview locally run:
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/
```

Licensing
- By contributing you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the repository's existing license (see `LICENSE`).

Thanks — maintainers will review PRs and provide feedback. If you'd like the maintainer to handle merging, mention that in the PR description.
